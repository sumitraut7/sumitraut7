# Hi, I'm Sumit 👋

I'm a computer science graduate student who enjoys building things at the intersection of machine learning, systems, and intelligent behavior.

I like working on problems where models meet real-world constraints — whether that's training neural networks, making distributed systems run faster, or teaching robots to understand what we ask them to do.

## What I enjoy working on

- 🧠 Turning research ideas into working systems
- ⚡ Machine learning that actually runs at scale (not just notebooks)
- 🎨 Generative models and representation learning
- 🌐 Distributed systems and backend engineering
- 🤖 Robots that can see, listen, and act — learning through reinforcement learning in games and simulation environments
- 🐛 Projects where debugging teaches you more than the paper did
