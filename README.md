# Hi, I'm Sumit 👋

I’m a computer science graduate student who enjoys building intelligent systems at the intersection of AI, Machine Learning, and Systems.

I like working on problems where models meet real-world constraints — whether that's training neural networks, making distributed systems run faster, or teaching robots to understand what we ask them to do.

## What I enjoy working on:

- 🧠 Turning research ideas into working systems
- ⚡ Machine learning that actually runs at scale (not just notebooks)
- 🎨 Generative models and representation learning
- 🌐 Distributed systems and backend engineering
- 🤖 Robots that can see, listen, and act — learning through reinforcement learning in games and simulation environments
- 🐛 Projects where debugging teaches you more than the paper did


## 🔬 Areas I’m Curious About:

- **🤖 Machine Learning** - Model training, optimization, MLOps, model deployment
- **🧠 Artificial Intelligence** - Intelligent systems, Reasoning, AI Agents 
- **🧬 Deep Learning** - Neural networks, architectures, optimization, scientific applications
- **✨ Generative AI** - diffusion models, VAEs, creative and multimodal generation
- **🎮 Reinforcement Learning** - RL in robotics, simulations, games, multi-agent systems
- **💬 Natural Language Processing** - LLMs, Transformers, language models
- **🌐 Distributed Systems** - Scalable architectures, fault tolerance, orchestration
- **☁️ Cloud Systems** - Cloud Services, containerization, Inference Systems, GPUs
- **👁️ Computer Vision** - object detection, VLMs, 3D scene reconstruction
